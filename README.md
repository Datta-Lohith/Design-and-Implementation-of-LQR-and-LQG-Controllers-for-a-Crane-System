## Installation Instructions
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the zip file.
2. Open the MATLAB files using MATLAB.
3. Run the relevant scripts to perform the simulations.

## Problem Statement
The provided scripts simulate the results needed to solve the final project requirements for the course.

### Usage
1. Execute the relevant MATLAB scripts based on the problem parts:
    - **Part C**: Controllability Check - [`Problem_C.m`](Project%20Code/Problem_C.m)
    - **Part D(a)**: LQR Design for a Linear System - [`Problem_D_1.m`](Project%20Code/Problem_D_1.m)
    - **Part D(b)**: LQR Design for a Non-Linear System - [`Problem_D_2.m`](Project%20Code/Problem_D_2.m)
    - **Part E**: Observability Check - [`Problem_E.m`](Project%20Code/Problem_E.m)
    - **Part F(a)**: Luenberger Observer for Linear Systems - [`Problem_f1.m`](Project%20Code/Problem_f1.m)
    - **Part F(b)**: Luenberger Observer for Non-Linear Systems - [`Problem_F2.m`](Project%20Code/Problem_F2.m)
    - **Part G(a)**: LQG Design for a Linear System - [`Problem_G_1.m`](Project%20Code/Problem_G_1.m)
    - **Part G(b)**: LQG Design for a Non-Linear System - [`Problem_G_2.m`](Project%20Code/Problem_G_2.m)

2. Each script will execute simulations and display corresponding graphs and matrices.
